  <h4>How to get the most accurate results for your heart rate?</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>For the most accurate results, tighten the WATCH firmly around your wrist. Even in ideal conditions, the WATCH may not be able to get a reliable heart rate reading for everyone. For a small percentage of users, various factors can make it impossible
      to give a heart rate reading. A couple of things can help WATCH to get the most consistent and best heart rate readings possible: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The back of the WATCH needs to contact the skin.</li>
      <li>The WATCH needs to be firmly tightened around your wrist but keep some space for your skin to breathe and let the sensors do their job.</li>
      <li>You can tighten your WATCH for workouts and loosen it after you are done.</li>
      <li>The sensors will only work if you wear the WATCH on the top of your wrist.
        <br>If your WATCH doesn't stay in place, or your heart rate can't be measured, tighten the band a bit. Your WATCH should be worn tight but comfortable.</li>
    </ul>
